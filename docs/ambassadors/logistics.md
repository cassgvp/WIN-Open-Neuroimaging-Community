# How many Ambassadors will take part in the pilot program?

In this pilot program, we will look to engage up to ten Ambassadors. Ultimately we would like to have an Ambassador in each of the WIN research  groups.

# How will the Ambassadors work together?

While working on creating documentation, we would like to have teams of two people working on each of the four focus areas of the infrastructure tools and a team working explicitly on community and policies. In all these efforts, all Ambassadors will be invited to contribute to the material and efforts of other teams, if they so wish.

# How long will Ambassadors be in-post for?

The pilot program will run from September 2021 to August 2022. All recruited Ambassadors will be expected to remain engaged with the program for this period, and should have confirmed posts as WIN members during this whole period.

# Who can be an ambassador?

Anyone! Student, postdoc, core staff, professional services...

# How can I become an Ambassador?

A competitive application for this program will be launched in September 2020. As part of the application you will be expected to describe why you are interested in becoming and Ambassador, what you will bring to the Ambassadors team and wider community, and what you will gain from being an Ambassador. You will also be asked to produce a letter of confirmation from your Supervisor or line manager stating that they support your engagement with the program and will allow you time away from your existing duties to take part in events and contribute between meetings.
