## What are we doing?

We are a community built from around 250 members of the University of Oxford [Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging (WIN)](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk). Our community exists to support open and inclusive researchers, to develop the tools, policies, governance and structures we would like in place to support us in practicing open science.

We are committed to supporting transparent and reproducible research practices within WIN, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of our research, and contribute to an equitable, diverse and inclusive research environment.

**See the sections below or navigate using the sidebar to find out more about the Open WIN Community.**
