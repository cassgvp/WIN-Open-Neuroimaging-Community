# What are the goals of the ambassador program?
We have created the ambassador program to ensure as many people as possible can access the sharing infrastructure created by the Open Neuroimaging Project.

We would also like to create opportunities for our community to engage learn best practice in open research, connect with each other, develop their experience and boost their CVs with open research outputs!

We also wanted to create a feedback system where our community of users can shape the environment which they work in. We are at the leading edge of these initiatives, and we firmly believe that our users are excellently positioned to contribute to the future of such efforts.

We have specific goals for engagement which are driven by the results of [WIN 2019 Open Science Survey](https://sharepoint.nexus.ox.ac.uk/sites/NDCN/FMRIB/SitePages/WIN%20Survey%20Results%202019.aspx) and the Project metrics which will be communicated to the [External Advisory Board (EAB)](https://sharepoint.nexus.ox.ac.uk/sites/NDCN/FMRIB/Shared%20Documents/EAB_TOR.pdf#search=external%20review%20board) who are tasked with providing "an external and independent view on plans and progress" of WIN. <mark> Can the 2018 EAB report be shared on intranet too?</mark>.

Based on these combined drivers, our initial goals are to:

<mark>These are taken from the EAB 2019 report. They don't look to be fantastically well aligned with the survey, but provide a good basis for new questions. The below I have not included as they are poorly specified or unachievable in the medium term. </mark>

- Increase in the number of preregistered projects <mark>MR is in general not ready to pre-register well, IMHO...</mark>
- Number of researchers trained in Open Science <mark> Underspecified and unmeasurable</mark>


## Improve awareness and experience with open research practices
- Increase in the number of open access papers immediately available
- Improve awareness of open research practices, particularly registered reports and open educational materials.
- Encourage the community to share pre-prints of their papers.

- Appreciate the value of open science practices in career development

![OS-Survey 2019 slide 4](../img/open-science-survey-results/Slide4.png)

- Appreciate the value of open sharing of code.
- Encourage the community to realise the value of sharing data within the current limits of our [open data policy](OpenData.md), and equip them with the tools and knowledge to do so.

## Reduce barriers to engaging in open research practices

- Devise and promote positive incentives for open research within WIN.
- Clarify and communicate legal and ethical obligations fo data sharing.
- Promote and train the community to use the newly developed WIN Open Infrastructure for sharing [data](OpenData.md), [experimental paradigms](OpenParadigms.md), [acquisition protocols](OpenProtocols.md) and [analysis tools](OpenTools.md)

## Create and share documentation
- Empower the community to learn together as we explore these topics, and share their knowledge on this repository <mark>update when moved</mark> in the form of written documentation.
- Hold in-person and online training workshops and "hacks" where we can learn together and create documentation.

## Demonstrate infrastructure engagement

Open Data
- Number of WIN researchers with database accounts
- Percentage of WIN researchers actively using the database
- Number of scans in the database
- Number of studies in the database
- Number of studies shared across WIN
- Number of studies shared externally
- Number of external requests to access studies


Open Paradigms
- Number of paradigms published on the website, potentially number of visits to the site
- Uplift in supporting documentation standards <mark>Added by CGVP. Much of the paradigms repo is pretty near unusable as so little documentation.</mark>

Open Protocols
- Number of protocols openly published in database
- Number of visits to the database and number of downloads
- Number of citations/acknowledgements of protocols used from the database

Open Tools
- Number of FSL tools that have singularity outputs
- Number of downloads of tools with singularity outputs
- Number of publications using singularity outputs
- Number of BIDS meetings attended

Open Community
<mark>TBC and consider more</mark>
- Number of Ambassadors
- Number of users on mailing lists and number of messages <mark>Can we look back at this historically?</mark>
- Number of users (active and inactive) on slack
- Number of contributors to this repository
- Number of enquires (and responses) made to Ambassadors
- Number of attendees at hack-day
- Feedback from hack-day
