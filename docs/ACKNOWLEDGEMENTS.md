We are grateful to the following resources for inspiration and shared documentation used to develop this repository
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Materials within this repository were developed with the support of the [Open Life Sciences (OLS) Mentoring Program](https://openlifesci.org), with the kind assistance of [Naomi Penfold](https://github.com/npscience). 🙏

The community strategy has been developed using materials shared by the [Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement - CSCCE](https://www.cscce.org) - community of practice. Guidance in community management and support has been generously provided by members of CSCCE. 🙏

Other resources have also been developed following example materials developed by [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome). 🙏

`The Turing Way Community, Becky Arnold, Louise Bowler, Sarah Gibson, Patricia Herterich, Rosie Higman, … Kirstie Whitaker. (2019, March 25). The Turing Way: A Handbook for Reproducible Data Science. Zenodo http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3233853.`

The Ambassadors scheme has been modelled on materials available from the [TU Delft Data Champions program](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/research-data-management/r/support/data-champions/). 🙏

Resources for creating the our community documentation hackathons have been created using templates and structures devised for the [Organisation of Human Brain Mapping](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org) [Open Science Special Interest Group](https://ossig.netlify.app) [Hackathon 2020](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2020/). 🙏

Figures have been created from images in the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) repository, contributed by [Alice Design](https://thenounproject.com/rose-alice-design/), [Andrejs Kirma](https://thenounproject.com/andrejs/), [DinosoftLab](https://thenounproject.com/dinosoftlab/), [Luis Prado](https://thenounproject.com/Luis/), [Sergey Demushkin](https://thenounproject.com/mockturtle/), [Thuy Nguyen]((https://thenounproject.com/milkghost/), [vectlab](https://thenounproject.com/vectlabmail/), and [Victor Llavata Bartual](https://thenounproject.com/victor.llavata/). 🙏
