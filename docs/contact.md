## Open WIN Slack ![slack](img/icon-slack.png)

Anyone affiliated with a WIN member Department is invited to [join our Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/openwin/signup). We have channels dedicated to each of the [sharing tools](tools.md), the [Open WIN community](community.md), and relevant external and internal [events](events.md).

**Slack is where the conversation will be most active and we will share resources with each other. If you're new to the Community, this should be your first contact point!**

The above [slack invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/openwin/signup) will accept email addresses from any of the University of Oxford domains listed below. If you think your domain should be listed here, or you are a WIN member without an email address at one of these domains, please email the [Open WIN Community Coordinator](https://cassgvp.github.io/WIN-Open-Neuroimaging-Community/docs/contact.html#email-the-open-win-community-coordinator-directly-).
